Write a detailed, step-by-step recipe for "${soup}" using the following main ingredients.

- Use numbered steps for instructions, without additional sub-points (like "a," "i").
- Organize the recipe as follows: Ingredients, Instructions, and Serving Suggestions.
- Each instruction step should be a complete sentence and avoid nested steps.
- Keep the tone formal and precise.

- Include cooking instructions, timings, and strict serving tips.
- Add ingredients or techniques based on descriptive words in the soup name. For example:
    - If the name includes "creamy," add ingredients to achieve a creamy texture.
    - If it says "spicy," add spices or peppers to increase heat.
    - If the name includes other descriptors, such as "herb-infused" or "smoky," adjust ingredients or techniques accordingly.`;
